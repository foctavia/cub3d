1. Parsing
	- map closed by walls 
	- map needs to be at the very end of the file
	- there can be spaces and empty line in between elements:

./cub3d /path/to/map

Example:
NO ./path_to_the_north_texture
F 220,100,0 -> valid Floor color spec
F                 220,100,0 -> valid

C 225,30,0

if error -> return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of your choice.


There needs to be line starting with:
NO, SO, WE, EA, F and C
else error


Texture, then floor then texture then C ?
if i get random value in my file like s;kdjflsj;dkdlff
